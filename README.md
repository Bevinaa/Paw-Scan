# üêæ Paw Scan

**Paw Scan** is a Flutter-based mobile application that classifies cat and dog breeds using deep learning transformer models. It acts as the mobile frontend for the project [Breed-Classification-of-Cats-and-Dogs-Using-Transformer-Architecture](https://github.com/Bevinaa/Breed-Classification-of-Cats-and-Dogs-Using-Transformer-Architecture), where image classification is handled via a backend hosted on Render.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This version requires an internet connection to send images to a web API. Hosted on Render's free tier ‚Äî may trigger memory limits if usage is high.

---

## ‚ú® Features

-  Capture or select an image of a cat or dog.
-  Backend uses ViT, Swin, and DeiT transformer models for breed classification.
-  Displays predicted breed name and confidence.
-  Communicates with a hosted Python API for inference.
